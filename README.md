# Code for Mehvish

A collection of code examples using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org), a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), and the [Elegoo Sensor Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/blogs/arduino-projects/elegoo-37-in-1-sensor-modules-kit-tutorial).

These examples are adapted from the Arduino code provided by Elegoo for use with the sensors from the kit.

# Development Tools

In addition to the hardware—the Pico dev board, the sensors, a breadboard, and some wires to connect them—you will need a text editor to edit the files on the Pico. This is best done with a code-specific editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

I recommend using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). It is a simple, free, Python-focused IDE that has some built in tools for working with CircuitPython. This includes a handy tools:

- a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) view that makes quick hacks and code output easy
- a plotter for visualizing numeric data from a sensor or device
- coding tools like object inspectors and autocomplete
